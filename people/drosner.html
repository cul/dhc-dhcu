He is also the Co-Director of the Center for the History &amp; Ethics of Public Health. His research focuses on the intersection of public health and social history and the politics of occupational disease and industrial pollution. He has been actively involved in lawsuits on behalf of cities, states and communities around the nation who are trying to hold the lead industry accountable for past acts that have resulted in tremendous damage to America’s children. Cases aimed at removing lead from children’s environments and compensating parents and governmental agencies for the costs of care and abatement of hazards in the home environment have grown out of his academic work. His work on the history of industry understanding the harms done by their industrial toxins has been part of law suits on behalf of asbestos workers and silicosis victims as well. Prior to joining the Columbia faculty in 1998, Dr. Rosner was University Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York. In 2010, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences’ National Academy of Medicine. In addition to numerous grants, he has been a Guggenheim Fellow, a recipient of a Robert Wood Johnson Investigator Award, a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellow and a Josiah Macy Fellow. He has been awarded the Distinguished Scholar’s Prize from the City University and the Viseltear Prize for Outstanding Work in the History of Public Health from the APHA, among others. He is the author, editor and co-author of 11 books on various aspects of the history of public health.</p></article><p>Related Projects:<br> <a href="/projects/toxicdocs.html"> Toxic Docs </a><br></p></div></div><footer><div id="footer-logo"><img src="/images/gsas.jpeg" alt="GSAS logo" width="200" height="100%"><img src="/images/cul.png" alt="Columbia Libraries logo" width="300" height="100%"></div><div id="footer-copyright"><span style="margin: 0">Copyrights 2020.
