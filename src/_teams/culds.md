The Columbia University Libraries are dedicated to the development of programs, services, spaces, and modes of engagement around technology in scholarship and research across its campuses. Together, these activities comprise a program of Digital Scholarship, which the libraries conduct through interactions in both physical and online venues. The libraries bring a wealth of expertise in information management, digital literacy, systems-support and development for online publishing, and engagement with technology to bear in a variety of ways, building on innovative programs to evolve a suite of services that respond to and anticipate the needs of Columbiaâ€™s research and learning communities. Through Digital Scholarship, the libraries create a forum that enables and advances the excellence of both students and faculty, supporting both instruction and production around digital methods, technologies, and platforms.
