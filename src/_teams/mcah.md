The Media Center for Art History, part of the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/" target="_blank">Department of Art History and Archaeology</a> at Columbia University, explores material culture, vision, media, and pedagogy in the broadest sense to connect faculty research and student learning through the creative application of technology. A motivated group of faculty principal investigators work with the Media Center to develop, conduct, and administer their projects in the study, interpretation, and conservation of works of art, monuments, or heritage sites.

Our goal is to examine and extend the ways of interpreting images, objects, buildings, and sites and to reinforce Columbia's historic strengths in core education for undergraduate students, graduate student training, and faculty research. Our specialized facilities and personnel serve the closely related fields of Archaeology, Art History, and Historic Preservation.

We maintain support for field study with faculty and students, whether in the cathedrals of France, the temples and shrines of Japan, or at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Such expeditions are distinctive of the Media Center's work. We are able to open up these global opportunities, identify means of support, create online resources, and distribute content.
