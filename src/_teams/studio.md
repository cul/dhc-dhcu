Not a team per se, the two Studios have been a catalyst for digital humanities work at Columbia University. Located in 208b Butler Library, and in Lehman 215, the Studios are dedicated to advancing pedagogy and scholarship. They host <a href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/">a range of group activities</a> related to the digital humanities—including workshops, presentations, digital labs, evaluations, talks, meetups and research sprints. The open labs on Fridays at Butler led to the formation of the Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities.

Members of the Columbia community are invited to request free use of the Studio for an educational or digital scholarship activity or project.
