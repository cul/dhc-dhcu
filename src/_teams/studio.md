Not a team per se, the Studio has been a catalyst for digital humanities work at Columbia University. Located originally in 208b Butler Library, the Studio is dedicated to advancing pedagogy and scholarship. It hosts <a href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/">a range of group activities</a> related to the digital humanities—including workshops, presentations, digital labs, evaluations, talks, meetups and research sprints. The open labs on Fridays led to the formation of the Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities.

Members of the Columbia community are invited to request free use of the Butler Studio for an educational or digital scholarship activity or project. To learn more, write to us at rds@library.columbia.edu
