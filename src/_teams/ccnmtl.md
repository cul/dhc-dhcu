CCNMTL has been a major contributor to Digital Humanities at Columbia University. In 2014 they were transformed and merged with other university units to form the Center for Teaching and Learning. The projects attributed to CCNMTL here are attributed to both. New ones created under the CTL banner will only be added there.
