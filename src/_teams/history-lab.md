 History has been likened to a vast tapestry, with every person and every place connected in patterns that unfold over time. We only begin to make out the meaning when we see how it is woven together into a larger whole. A loose thread or a tear in the fabric can change the picture, or even cause it to unravel, making it impossible to recover the lessons of the past.

Now the amount of information is becoming overwhelming, more and more of it is lost or destroyed, and the most crucial parts are kept secret and out of view. In the past, archivists carefully curated key documents, photos, and artifacts. But they can no longer cope with the exponential growth of information, much of it classified.

The mission of the history lab is to use data science to recover and repair the fabric of the past. We are beginning with declassified documents, which include some of the earliest examples of electronic records. By bringing together fragmented collections in a common database, we can use natural language processing and machine learning tools to explore them. The ultimate goal is to develop history as a data science so that citizens can keep government accountable in the age of big data.
