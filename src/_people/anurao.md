Anupama Rao, Associate Professor History (Barnard) and Associate Director, ICLS is a recent convert to the Digital Humanities. After participating in a 'boot camp' on Spatial Mapping in the Urban Humanities this past Summer (2016), Rao transformed her upper-level seminar on the colonial and postcolonial history of Bombay/Mumbai to include spatial mapping and spatial history as key components of urban and labor history pedagogy. She is currently working on a multimedia archive to accompany her introduction of the autobiography of the little-known Dalit Communist, R. B. Mor√©.
