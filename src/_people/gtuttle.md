Professor Tuttle, in his <em>Tibetan Buddhists in the Making of Modern China </em>(ColumbiaUniversity Press, 2005), examines the failure of nationalism and race-based ideology to maintain the Tibetan territory of the former Qing empire as integral to the Chinese nation-state. His current research project, for a book tentatively entitled “Amdo (Qinghai/Gansu): Middle Ground between Lhasaand Beijing,” focuses on Tibetan Buddhist institutional growth from the seventeenth to the twentieth century and how economic growth in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands fueled expansion and renewal of these institutions into the contemporary period. 

Professor Tuttle teaches courses on modern Tibetan history, the history of Chinese and Tibetan Buddhist relations, nationalist historiography in East Asia, and Tibetan civilization. Combining his teaching and research insterests with emergent technologies, Prof. Tuttle has been a leading advocate of digital humanities in East Asian Studies at Columbia.
