Bob Scott has been, since 1994, the head of the the Digital Humanities Center Computer Lab (originally known as the Electronic Text Service), which aims to provide basic support for Columbia scholars working with text, image, and video.  His own interests and expertise focus particularly on the digitization, markup, and analysis of text and the management individual scholarly research collections.  Thanks to his own graduate training, he has a special interest in Russian and East European resources and in medieval and early modern material.  He is currently engaged in two major projects -- digitization and online mounting of the data set assembled for the Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry, and Chartex, a project that attempts to apply text mining, natural language processing, and other computer analysis to the texts of medieval documents.
