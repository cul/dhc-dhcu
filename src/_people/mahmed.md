<p>My interests in DH began in the late 90s with efforts to create and work on large corpora at Chicago. My initial work was in database and programming. I teach an annual Digital Humanities workshop for graduate students and faculty in the History department called "Digital History Bouquet". In my courses, I integrate methods and analytical tools from varied DH projects in teaching South Asia. I am currently focused on visualization the spatial imagination in medieval Arabic and Persian geographic texts. A version of this project was developed at the Berlin Graduate School of Muslim Cultures in 2011 around the Mughal city of Shahjahanabad.</p>

<p>I am deeply interested in the theoretical import of global interaction with digital humanities - the issues raised by disparities in race, gender, and accessibility of the programming/institutional basis of DH.</p>
