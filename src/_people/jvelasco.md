Prof. Rodríguez-Velasco has been a strong advocate of digital scholarship in LAIC. During his tenure as chair he was instrumental in imagining and implementing <a href="http://laic.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">the departatmental website</a> as a digital humanities project. More recently he has worked with Prof. Bernard Harcourt (Law School) to conduct year long seminars on Nietzsche and Foucault, that leverage effectively open access and social media platforms. He has also taught courses in "Digital Storytelling." He is currently working on his next digital humanities project, The Legal Workshop.
