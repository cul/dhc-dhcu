I am a 4th year PhD student at the Latin American and Iberian Cultures Department here at Columbia University (NYC). I am interested in how the affective memory of the Spanish transition to democracy is depicted through fictions of the self in the neoliberal era. In my previous life, I used to live in Córdoba (Spain), where I worked on Early Modern Andalusian poetry. Aside from pondering these ideas in the ivory tower, I've dabbled in Digital Humanities and have [built my own site](http://almudenamc.github.io/) (work in progress). I believe that DH brings together some of the main characteristics that academia should foster: collaborative work, and immediate peer-reviewed feedback, as well as an open and democratic platform to socially expose the intricacies of our cognitive processes as human beings.
