Karl Jacoby is a specialist in environmental, borderlands, and Native American history.  His books include Crimes Against Nature: Squatters, Poachers, Thieves and the Hidden History of American Conservation and Shadows at Dawn: A Borderlands Massacre and the Violence of History.  

In 2013, when he began writing his book, *[The Strange Career of William Ellis: The Texas Slave who Became a Mexican Millionaire](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294990726)* he created a website to help him gather information about Ellis. That website is today [his homepage](http://karljacoby.com/). For his previous book,  *[Shadows at Dawn](http://www.brown.edu/Research/Aravaipa/index.html)*, he had also built a companion site to hold much of the documentary evidence to accompany the book.
