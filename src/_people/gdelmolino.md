Grace Delmolino is a PhD candidate in the Department of Italian and the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society. Her research interests include Boccaccio, Dante, Petrarch, canon law, economic history, and gender studies. Her dissertation, “Boccaccio’s Law,” historicizes Boccaccio’s study of canon law and argues that his legal training catalyzed the attention to women and gender issues that we see in the Decameron as well as his other works.

This work on medieval law and literature is guided by an engagement with contemporary critical and feminist theory. In addition to a concentration in Comparative Literature and Society, Grace has completed the Certificate in Feminist Scholarship at Columbia’s Institute for Research on Women, Gender, and Sexuality, where she was also awarded the 2014-15 IRWGS Graduate Fellowship.

She was one of twelve [Teagle Fellows](https://teagle.wikischolars.columbia.edu/Teagle+Fellows) (now Peer Teaching Consultants) in 2014-15 and currently serves as Senior Assistant Editor of [Digital Dante](http://digitaldante.columbia.edu/).

Her essay “Francesca and Filippa: Boccaccio’s Canon-Legal Theory of Consent in Esposizioni 5 and Decameron 6.7” won the 2015 Giuseppe Velli Prize for best graduate student essay on Boccaccio. Other recent work includes an article titled “The Economics of Conjugal Debt from the Decretum to Decameron 2.10,” forthcoming in Reconsidering Boccaccio: Medieval Contexts and Global Intertexts (eds. Olivia Holmes and Dana Stewart, under review). She will be contributing a reading of Decameron 9.7 to the Lectura Boccaccii series sponsored by the American Boccaccio Association.

Before coming to Columbia, she received a BA in English from Mount Holyoke College (2007) and a BA in Italian, German, and Creative Writing from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (2011). She earned her MA in Italian at Columbia in 2012, and her MPhil in Italian and ICLS in 2014.
