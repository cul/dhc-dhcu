I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://classicalstudies.columbia.edu/students/%20joe%20sheppard/" target="_blank">Classical Studies</a> department, writing my dissertation about the culture of mass spectacles in Roman Pompeii. My principal interest is the social history of the Roman Empire through its literary, archaeological, epigraphic, and numismatic sources. At Butler's <a href="https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/dcip/" target="_blank">Digital Centers Internship Program</a>, I began marking up web editions of <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079698/" target="_blank">unpublished Greek and Latin inscriptions</a> kept in the <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml.html" target="_blank">Rare Book and Manuscript Library</a> using <a href="http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/dev/" target="_blank">EpiDoc</a> (a field-specific series of guidelines and protocols that spun off from the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/" target="_blank">Text Encoding Initiative</a>). I have continued this project on the back-burner with a few colleagues (<a href="https://github.com/Spunkle/EPIGRAPHY-CLUB-2015" target="_blank">see here for our repository</a>), and we hope this year to publish these new texts with their metadata at the <a href="http://usepigraphy.brown.edu/projects/usep/" target="_blank">US Epigraphy Project</a>. In my fieldwork as a trench supervisor at <a href="http://columbia.studioabroad.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&amp;Program_ID=10577" target="_blank">Columbia's excavations at Villa Adriana</a>, I developed tools for gathering high-quality information digitally in the trench, and I am excited about working with the team this year to expand the paperless workflow, including the improvement, storage, and publication of our data.
