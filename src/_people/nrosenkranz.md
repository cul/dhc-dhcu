- The Making and Knowing Project
---

Naomi Rosenkranz is the Project Manager of the [Making and Knowing Project](http://www.makingandknowing.org/), a research cluster of the Center for Science and Society that is working to create an open-access critical digital edition of an intriguing artisanal, technical 16th-century French manuscript. The Project brings together participants from the humanities, arts, and sciences to foster new connections and insights through interdisciplinary research, knowledge exchange, teaching (including graduate seminars in historical laboratory reconstructions and digital humanities). 
Naomi serves as the main administrative liaison between the various research, editorial, and digital activities of the Project staff, collaborators, and participants. She supports the historical reconstruction research, oversees the Project’s chemical laboratory, and maintains the digital collaboration systems. 

Naomi received her BA in physics from Barnard College in 2015, concentrating her research experiences in materials science and engineering (including synthesis and characterization of superconductors and photoconductive properties of organic nanorods). In 2014-15, she served as the inaugural Science Resident in Conservation with Columbia’s Ancient Ink Lab, identifying and characterizing ancient carbon-based inks. She continued her investigation of inks at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, working with the departments of Scientific Research and Paper Conservation to examine medieval iron-tannate black inks through recipe reconstructions and spectral analysis of museum objects.
