<p align="left"><span class="text">My teaching and research areas include francophone/postcolonial literatures and cinemas of North Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean and the cultural dimensions of migration and diaspora. I also teach and write about eighteenth-century French culture, particularly with regard to orientalism, colonialism and the history of slavery.

<p align="left"><span class="text">My most recent book, co-written with historian Myriam Cottias, is a critical re-edition of two mid twentieth-century novels by the Martinican writer, Mayotte Cap√©cia. Our introductory essay explores the convergence of race, gender, colonialism and the Vichy regime that formed the context of these two polygraphic texts. </span></p>

Together with Prof. Emmanuelle Saada, Prof. Dobie has been an advocate for graduate student work in digital humanities in French and Francophone Studies at Columbia University.
