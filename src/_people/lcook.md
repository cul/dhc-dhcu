Lindsay is an advanced Ph.D. candidate specializing in Gothic architecture. Her dissertation considers the role of the cathedral chapter of Notre-Dame of Paris in the construction of parish churches in the Paris region. She earned her M.A. (2013) and M.Phil. (2014) from Columbia and her B.A. in Art History and French from Vassar College (2010). As an undergraduate, she wrote a thesis about projects—including one by Philip Johnson—for a new chapel at Vassar in the 1950s, and she worked for two summers at Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House. Before entering the Ph.D. program, Lindsay contributed to an exhaustive public sculpture database for the Chicago Park District, worked on the 2011 French Decorative Arts Symposium at the Alliance Française de Chicago, and served as a panorama photographer for [Mapping Gothic France](http://mappinggothic.org/). Her M.A. paper at Columbia considered the propaganda value of photography in a 1919 book about Reims Cathedral. She contributed to the Rare Book and Manuscript Library exhibition of medieval Bibles Writing the Word, the digital humanities project [Chant Manuscripts](https://chantmanuscripts.omeka.net/), and the print catalogue for The Architect's Library, an exhibition of notable architectural books from the collection at Vassar. She is currently a consultant for FAB-Musiconis, a collaborative digital humanities project in medieval musical iconography. As a complement to her research, Lindsay has coordinated undergraduate study trips to Amiens and Jerusalem for art history travel seminars and served as the program assistant for interdisciplinary Columbia summer programs in Paris and Venice.
