W.B. Worthen has worked widely on modern and contemporary performance, and frequently writes about the intersection between theatre and digital media; his 2014 book, *Shakespeare Performance Studies* (Cambridge University Press), is partly concerned with theatre in the era of digital humanities, and he has published several articles on drama as “information.”
