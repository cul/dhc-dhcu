Mark Phillipson leads the Graduate Student Teaching Initiatives and Programs team in the CTL, designing and producing pedagogical and professional development programs and resources for faculty, graduate students, and other instructors at Columbia. He oversees a range of institutes, workshops, fellowships, consultations, learning communities, and other teaching programs in the CTL, and cultivates a range of partnerships across campus in support of high quality instructional practices.

Before joining the CTL, Mark served as Director of the GSAS Teaching Center at Columbia where he launched initiatives such as the Lead Teaching Fellows pilot, the Peer Teaching Consultant program, and the Innovative Teaching Summer Institute—all of which continue within the CTL. Mark has partnered with faculty, librarians, and media archivists to develop projects engaging students with digital collections in innovative ways—such as Sacred Gotham, Mapping the African American Past, the Virtual Forest Initiative, and Mediathread.

Mark also teaches in the Core Curriculum and in Columbia’s English Department, where he has led seminars in British Romanticism—such as Multimedia Blake, Byron and the Byronic, the Romantic Sublime and others. Before working at Columbia, he was an assistant professor of English at Bowdoin College; his early models of class wikis attracted coverage from EDUCAUSE and the Chronicle of Higher Education. Mark holds a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, an MLIS from Simmons College, and a B.A. in English from Columbia College.
