Tim received his MA in Art History from Columbia with a thesis that used 3D modeling and global illumination technologies to examine the lighting conditions of Ancient Greek domestic interiors at the city of Olynthus. During his time as a student at Columbia, Tim worked in the Media Center and was delighted to become part of the full-time staff upon graduation. He is passionate about the use of new technologies within the humanities and is excited to be a part of the Media Center's future projects.
