Professor Marcus’s interests include media and performance studies; nineteenth-century British and French literature (with a focus on the novel, drama, and performance culture); literary theory; and gender and sexuality studies. Her B.A. and Ph.D. degrees are both in comparative literature. She has taught courses on theater and the novel, literature and the city, narrative theory, new methods in literary studies, the history of sexuality, and feminist and queer theory. She also regularly teaches in Columbia’s Core Curriculum.

Marcus is currently completing a book entitled The Drama of Celebrity, under contract to Princeton University Press. Drafts of chapters from The Drama of Celebrity, along with many of Marcus's scholarly articles, are available on Columbia’s Academic Commons, here. She is the author of Apartment Stories: City and Home in Nineteenth-Century Paris and London (University of California Press, 1999), which received an honorable mention for the MLA Scaglione Prize for best book in comparative literature, and Between Women: Friendship, Desire, and Marriage in Victorian England (Princeton University Press, 2007), which has been translated into Spanish. Between Women won the Perkins Prize for best study of narrative, the Albion prize for best book on Britain after 1800, the Alan Bray Memorial award for best book in queer studies, and a Lambda Literary award for best book in LGBT studies.

Her essays have appeared in Theatre Survey, Public Culture, MLQ, Representations, PMLA, Victorian Studies, Social Research, The Blackwell Companion to Comparative Literature, and The Cambridge History of Victorian Literature. She has also written for The Boston Globe, The Chronicle Review, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times Book Review.

In 2009, with Stephen Best, Prof. Marcus co-edited a special issue of Representations on "The Way We Read Now," with an introduction entitled “Surface Reading.” In 2016, with Heather Love and Stephen Best, she co-edited a second special issue of Representations on “Description Across Disciplines.” In 2014, with Katherine Biers, she co-edited a special issue of Nineteenth Century Theatre and Film on global performance networks, and in 2015, she guest edited a special issue of the journal Public Culture on "Celebrities and Publics in the Internet Era."

In 2012, Marcus co-founded [Public Books](http://www.publicbooks.org/), an online review of books, arts, and ideas, for which she currently serves as co-editor in chief.

The recipient of Fulbright, Woodrow Wilson, and ACLS fellowships, and a Columbia Distinguished Faculty Award, Marcus serves on several editorial boards and is a fellow of the New York Institute for Humanities. In July 2014, Marcus was appointed Dean of Humanities at Columbia University. Her priorities as dean include supporting teaching and research; promoting collaboration across departments, schools, and divisions; and developing and enacting a strategic plan to make the humanities more digital, more public, and more global.
