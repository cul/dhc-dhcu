Allison Busch's research centers on early modern Hindi literature and intellectual history, with a special interest in courtly India. She did her Ph.D. (granted with distinction in 2003) at the University of Chicago in the department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations. She has published several articles on the literary and intellectual life of seventeenth-century sub-imperial courts. Poetry of Kings, her new book on Mughal- period Hindi literary culture, is <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/Hinduism/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199765928">now available</a> from Oxford University Press. An edited volume (with Dr. Thomas de Bruijn of Leiden University) in progress focuses on the circulation of culture in late pre-colonial India. Her current research is on local histories from the Mughal-period that were recorded in Hindi's classical dialect, Brajbhasha.
