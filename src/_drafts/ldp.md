The Libraries Digital Program was launched in 2002 with the formation of the [Libraries Digital Program Division](https://library.columbia.edu/bts/ldp/ldpd.html) (LDPD). LDPD works closely with the [Preservation and Digital Conversion Division](https://library.columbia.edu/bts/preservation.html) and special collections curators, as well as faculty and other CU organizations to publish and preserve Columbia's unique digital collections and to develop and promote the infrastructure and resources to support digital library efforts both today and in the future.  In 2008 the Libraries Digital Program Division took on responsibility for the Libraries' long term digital preservation program.
