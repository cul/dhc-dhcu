The Marenzio Online Digital Edition is part of the <a href="http://www.marenzio.org/">Marenzio Project</a>. MODE aims at making available for the first time, and online, a complete critical edition of the secular music of <a title="Luca Marenzio" href="http://marenzio.cdrs.columbia.edu/luca-marenzio/">Luca Marenzio</a> (ca. 1553-1599), one of the most important composers of the European Renaissance.  Since 2005, MODE’s <a title="Participants in the Marenzio Project" href="http://marenzio.cdrs.columbia.edu/participants-in-mode/">international research group</a> has been working not only at providing a reliable edition of Marenzio’s music but also at changing the landscape of music editions. By innovatively integrating music philology and digital technology, MODE introduces a new model for both generating and disseminating modern editions of musical repertories of the Western tradition.
