Hilary A. Hallett specializes in nineteenth and twentieth century cultural history, both in the U.S. and in transatlantic perspective.   Her research interests focus on the history of popular culture, comparative feminisms, and gender and sexuality.  Her first book, <em>Go West Young Women! The Rise of Early Hollywood</em>, was published by the University of California Press in 2013.  <em>Go West</em>! demonstrates how the transformation of the American film industry into Hollywood influenced the development of Los Angeles and broader ideas about women and sexual modernism.  Her current project, <em>The Syren Within: Elinor Glyn and the Invention of Glamour </em><em>(under contract with Liveright-Norton), </em>explores the transatlantic networks that supported the success of the English author, Elinor Glyn (1864 – 1943).  With the publication of <em>Three Weeks</em> (1907), Glyn helped to invent the most commercially successful, and critically reviled, genre of twentieth-century English fiction: romance novels with an explicit erotic edge.  Her success as a writer and celebrity author brought her to Hollywood as an “Eminent Author,” where she became one of the industry’s most influential personalities during the 1920s.
