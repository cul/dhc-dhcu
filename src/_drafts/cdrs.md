The Center for Digital Research and Scholarship (CDRS), one of six entities that comprise the Digital Programs and Technology Services branch of Columbia University Libraries/Information Services, works with the faculty, students, and staff of Columbia University and its affiliates to increase the utility and impact of their research and scholarship. In pursuit of this mission, CDRS creates, adapts, implements, supports, and sustains innovative digital tools and publishing platforms for content delivery, discovery, analysis, data curation, and preservation. CDRS also engages in extensive outreach, education, and advocacy to ensure that the scholarly work produced at Columbia University has a global reach and accelerates the pace of research across disciplines.
