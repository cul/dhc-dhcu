The Art Atlas platform provides an interface for the mapping and photography-based projects of Columbia University's Department of Art History and Archaeology. The projects feature still images and 360Â° panoramas taken by Columbia faculty, staff, fellows and students at various cultural sites around the world, including but not limited to. These same teams later add textual data and historical materials to provide detailed information about each site alongside the visual resources.

Projects include [Japanese Architecture](https://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/japanese-architecture), [Modern Architecture of Chicago](https://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/modern-architecture-chicago), [The American Southwest](https://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/american-southwest), [Ancient and Early Christian Sites of Rome](https://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/ancient-and-early-christian-sites-rome) and [Venice and Its Lagoon](https://mcid.mcah.columbia.edu/art-atlas/venice-and-its-lagoon).
