Writ Large: New York City’s Educational Past from the Ground Up contributes to a comprehensive understanding of New York City’s educational past by locating formal and informal sites of teaching and learning in neighborhoods across time and by identifying archival resources in New York City repositories (and elsewhere) to document that history. By mapping sites that include, among others, branch public libraries, Catholic parochial schools, social settlements, faith-based colleges, professional trade schools, playgrounds, and local YMCAs, Writ Large is designed to document the multiple settings in which diverse New Yorkers learned and capture the reciprocal relationship between education and the transformation of the city. The phrase in the title, “from the Ground Up,” refers both to inquiry into the built (educational) environment on the neighborhood level and a primary objective of the project to generate new perspectives about the history of the city and networks of teaching and learning from the archival record up. In development, Writ Large is a collaboration between the Center on History and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Center for Teaching and Learning at Columbia University. The first stage of the project was piloted in the course, “History of Education in New York City,” taught in the Spring of 2018 at Teachers College by Dr. Bette Weneck. This stage of the project focuses on sites of teaching and learning in the borough of Manhattan.
