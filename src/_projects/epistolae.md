<a href="http://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/">Epistolae</a> is a collection of letters to and from women dating from the 4th to the 13th century AD. These letters from the Middle Ages, written in Latin, are presented with English translations and are organized by the women participating. Biographical sketches of the women and descriptions of the subject matter or the historic context of the letter is included where available.

Dr. Joan Ferrante, Professor Emeritus of English and Comparative Literature, of Columbia University has collected and translated these letters mainly from printed sources. Professor Ferrante worked with the <a href="http://ctl.columbia.edu/">Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning</a> to develop this unique open online repository of the collection for teaching and research purposes.
