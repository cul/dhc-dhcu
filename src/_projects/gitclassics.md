On account of projects like Google Books and the Internet Archive, there are literally tens of thousands of new Latin texts available on the Internet. Many well-known texts from antiquity are available at The Perseus Project, and even some medieval and early modern texts are available at The Latin Library, but there is still an enormous amount of Latin literature that is available only as scanned images, not as plaintext. To get an idea of the amount of material out there, take a look at the collection of Latin language texts available at HathiTrust.

GitClassics aims to make some of these obscure Latin texts more readily available by editing, translating, and publishing them on GitHub.
