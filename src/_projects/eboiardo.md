eBOIARDO is an academic, non-commercial site created by Jo Ann Cavallo for her Columbia University courses on the romance epic (especially Renaissance Chivalric Epic and Folk Performance Traditions). The main focus is on theatrical, musical, and artistic representations based on Boiardo’s Orlando Innamorato, Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso, and other Italian Renaissance romance epics. The bulk of the videos feature Sicilian puppet theater and the epic Maggio of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines, including scenes from several plays and some interviews that Cavallo filmed between 2001 and the present.
