FAB-Musiconis is a project of Columbia University and Paris-Sorbonne University made possible by a three-year grant from the Partner University Fund of the FACE Foundation. The Project Leaders are Susan Boynton (Columbia) and Frédéric Billiet (Paris-Sorbonne). Beginning in 2016, five graduate student medievalists from each of the two partner universities will be selected each fall to participate in a program of activities for the academic year, including two-week intensive exchanges in Paris and New York.

The project will give graduate students in several disciplines of the humanities a well-rounded formation in digital humanities approaches to the analysis and description of medieval images of music (which appear in media including manuscript illumination, sculpture, stained glass, wall painting, and Gothic ivories), with a focus on the Sorbonne’s Musiconis metabase. Students learn historical, critical, and technical methods for creating new database records and also enrich their research through the acquisition of multidisciplinary skills in the digital humanities. (For more information on the pedagogical goals of the program please see the full description of the learning goals and outcomes). FAB-Musiconis will consolidate the ongoing collaboration between the Sorbonne and Columbia, and increase the scope and reach of the Musiconis database. The multidisciplinary group includes musicologists, art historians, and computer scientists whose collaborative research for this and other projects focuses particularly on the development of new methods for cataloguing images and on applications of ontologies and linked data to the classification of musical iconography.
