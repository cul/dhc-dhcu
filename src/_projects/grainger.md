This project originated from a desire to create an openly accessible edition of James Grainger’s The Sugar-Cane that could be used for undergraduate and graduate teaching. Although The Sugar-Cane had largely fallen into obscurity by the early twentieth century, there has been an upsurge of scholarly interest in the text in recent decades, especially as literary historians and others have focused on understanding the histories of Caribbean plantations and slavery, both of which topics The Sugar-Cane deals extensively with. Just as importantly, scholars have become interested in thinking about how Grainger’s poem also could be used to understand histories of indigenous and Afro-Caribbean resistance in the face of colonization and enslavement. Our main goal in creating this edition, then, was to translate some of these new insights into an accessible form so that students, as well as researchers, could benefit from them.
