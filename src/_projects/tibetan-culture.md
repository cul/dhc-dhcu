The Tibetan Culture website at Columbia University is the product of over a decade of student projects, brought together in a single space with the support of the WEAI and the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). Most of the sites on this page represent individual student projects in the Tibetan Civilization course offered once each year. Students write an object biography to tell the story of a Tibetan artifact through a careful analysis of the object and an engagement with relevant sources about this aspect of Tibetan material history. Students also completed final projects exploring aspects of Tibetan culture ranging from music, movies and art to explorations of Tibet in NYC (food, museums, mediation centers). The best projects from the last several years (many utilizing the CTL's Mediathread tool) are posted here. Additional sites were generated by entire classes working together over the course of a semester or even across several years, mostly using  Wikischolar websites. These include many timelines (chronologies of biographical writing, travel in Tibet, interactions with China, etc.) as well as several fascinating mapping projects."
