This work in progress will feature a blog, an online journal, bibliographic reviews, and, more importantly, two more sections: "Glossae," an experimental collaborative platform for the research of legal glosses (the central intellectual activity for the creation of legal concepts), both historical and contemporary, all geotagged and chronolocated; The other section will be an ongoing catalog of geotagged and chronolocated legal works, with a especial focus on legal manuscripts from the Middle Ages. 

The site is fully designed and several glosses, journal issues, and other content is underway.
