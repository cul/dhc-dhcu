Jazz Studies Online is a Web site developed by the Columbia University Center for Jazz Studies, in association with the Center for Digital Research and Scholarship (CDRS) and the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL), and with funding from the Ford Foundation.

The site is comprised of an extensive digital resource library, including author and artist interviews, short essays, online dialogues with scholars, book excerpts, audio and video recordings, scholarly papers and conference proceedings, and feature articles. The site forges partnerships with publishers, journals and magazines, scholarly associations, archives, libraries, museums, musicians, educators, and academic institutions.The site also includes a multimedia Jazz Glossary with definitions, short essays, and sonic and visual demonstrations of a variety of jazz vocabulary terms. Long-term goals of Jazz Studies Online include the development of a collaborative environment for digital scholarship in jazz studies, and the creation of new teaching tools for jazz curricula.
