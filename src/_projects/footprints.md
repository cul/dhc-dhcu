Footprints is a crowdsourced project to capture the huge corpus of data relating to the movement of Jewish books found in, but not limited to: owners' marks, auction records, bookplates, owner/bookdealer correspondence.  The project will open new areas of research in the history of the book, Jewish Studies, and many other fields.
