Digital Dante is a platform for innovative contemporary scholarship on Dante and his works that evolved from one of the digital humanities projects at Columbia in the 1990s. Under the direction of Professor Teodolinda Barolini, this new iteration of Digital Dante is a collaboration between Columbia's Department of Italian, Columbia University Libraries' Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, and Columbia University Libraries' Humanities and History Division, with an editorial board that features current and former graduate students. Some of the many highlights of the site are an edition of The Divine Comedy that features a canto-by-canto commentary by Professor Barolini (the Commento Baroliniano), digitized images from early print editions housed in Columbiaâ€™s Rare Book and Manuscript Library, and Intertextual Dante, a new method of highlighting and interpreting Ovidian intertexts in The Divine Comedy by Julie Van Peteghem.
