<a href="https://twitter.com/rikersbot">Rikers StoryBot</a> is a coding workshop and an algorithmic storytelling project set in and about Rikers Island correctional facility, New York city’s main jail complex.

In the spring of 2015, the <a href="http://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/">Center for Justice</a> approached the <a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/">Experimental Methods Group</a> with an idea of running an “Intro to <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>” workshop for the young people incarcerated at Rikers and for Columbia University students interested in digital literacy. It was important for us to set up the encounter in a way that moves past one way conversation with effects that persist beyond the one time event.

In teaching programming through digital storytelling, it is our hope to encourage a dialog between the youth at Rikers, Columbia faculty and students, and the community at large.

The Rikers StoryBot project gives all participants a chance to have their voices heard, to learn to code, and to gain real-world experience in writing, editing, and producing a project. Together, we are building a <a href="https://twitter.com/rikersbot">Twitter bot</a> that will tell our story.
