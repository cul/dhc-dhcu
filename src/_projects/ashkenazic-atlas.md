The Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry (1959-1972) was a very early "big data" project, containing over 100,000 pages of field notes documenting dialectal differences for speakers of Yiddish from across Europe.  The project was a pioneer of the digital age, and interview responses were entered into a computer with the idea that they could ultimately be manipulated electronically. Thanks to a generous grant <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/news/libraries/2015/2015-03-31_National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities.html">from the National Endowment for the Humanities</a>, the Columbia University Libraries will be digitizing the entire corpus of the LCAAJ project data.  Due to the complexity of the archive, we will also create a user-friendly website which will serve as a "virtual reading room" for this important and extensive collection.
