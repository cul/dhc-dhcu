<a href="http://jonreeve.com/projects/annotags/about.html" target="_blank">Annotags</a> is a decentralized textual annotation protocol that encodes bibliographic data into a microbloggable textual location hashtag. Related open-source software projects include a <a href="http://jonreeve.com/projects/annotags" target="_blank">web app</a> that transforms ISBNs and other identifiers into hashtags, and a <a href="http://jonreeve.com/2015/04/a-bookmarklet-for-creating-annotags" target="_blank">bookmarklet</a> that produces hashtags from ebooks and WorldCat entries. A mobile app is in development. Using Annotags, scholars may have discussions in the virtual margins of a text, and literature students may tweet their responses to assigned readings.
