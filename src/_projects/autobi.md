<a href="http://eniac.cs.qc.cuny.edu/andrew/autobi/index.html">AuToBI</a> is a tool written by Andrew Rosenberg for the automatic analysis of Standard American English prosody. Open source and written in Java, AuToBI hypothesizes pitch accents and phrase boundaries consistent with the ToBI prosodic annotation standard. The toolkit includes an acoustic feature extraction front-end, and a classification backend supported by the Weka machine learning toolkit. The tool is based largely on work described Andrew Rosenberg's dissertation, "<a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~amaxwell/amaxwell-thesis-final.pdf">Automatic Detection and Classification of Prosodic Events</a>," while a student at the Computer Science Department at Columbia University.
