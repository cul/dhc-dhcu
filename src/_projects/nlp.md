Natural Language Processing research at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> is conducted in the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Computer Science Department</a>, the <a href="http://www.ccls.columbia.edu/">Center for Computational Learning Systems</a> and the <a href="http://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/">Biomedical Informatics Department</a>. Due to the broad expertise and wide ranging interests of our NLP researchers, NLP@CU has a distinctive combination of depth and breadth. Our research combines linguistic insights into phenomena of interest with rigorous, cutting edge methods in machine learning and other computational approaches. Some of this work includes work in the digital humanities. To learn more we invite you to look at our <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/tools.cgi">tools section</a>.
