This project traces Rock-cut Archicteture in India. Indian rock-cut architecture is more various and found in greater abundance than any other form of rock-cut architecture around the world. Rock-cut architecture is the practice of creating a structure by carving it out of solid natural rock. Rock that is not part of the structure is removed until the only rock left are the architectural elements of the excavated interior. Indian rock-cut architecture is mostly religious in nature. There are known more than 1,500 rock cut structures in India. Many of these structures contain artworks of global importance, most are adorned with exquisite stone carvings. These ancient and medieval structures are amazing achievements of structural engineering and craftmanship.
