<a href="http://jdisc.columbia.edu/">J-DISC</a> is a tool for searching and exploring jazz recordings created by the <a class="ext" href="http://jazz.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University</a>. It incorporates a broad range of information on major jazz recordings within a single repository.  This resource is meant to be used for research on jazz and its recorded legacy or simply for exploring the people, repertoire, and culture of jazz. J-DISC is a collaborative project among jazz researchers and professionals, and it will continue to grow in scope in the near future.  Our aim is to enter virtually complete data on recording sessions by 75 significant jazz artists, allow experts in our field to update and comment on that data, and then continually update it as new information becomes available.
