Oral History Works is a portal for Oral History MA Program students' multimedia work, including theses, edited audio pieces, and materials from our annual interactive multimedia pop-up exhibit. The site was developed in partnership with Columbia Universityâ€™s Center for Teaching and Learning, with support from the Digital Humanities Center. Special thanks to CTL staff Andre Laboy and Ellen Maleszewski, OHMA student and digital humanities fellow Mario Alvarez, and OHMA project coordinator and event photographer Erica Fugger for their collaborative contributions.
