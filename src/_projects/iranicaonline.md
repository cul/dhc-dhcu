The Encyclopaedia Iranica (EIr) is dedicated to the study of Iranian civilization in the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Indian Subcontinent.  The collaborative project was established by Ehsan Yarshater at Columbia's Center for Iranian Studies in the 1970s, and is supported by an international research community.  Since 1978, the project has received numerous grants from the NEH.

The EIr's first printed fascicle appeared in 1982, and in 1996 the Encyclopaedia Iranica established its own website where all content is available Open-Access.  Since 2010 <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org">the online edition</a>
has become the project's focus, though printed fascicles continue to be published.  As of January 2015, the EIr comprises about 9,000 entries, and about 12 percent are born-digital.
<div>All entries are commissioned by invitation only and subject of peer review to ensure factual reliability, scholarly objectivity, and political independence.</div>
