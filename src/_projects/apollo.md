The <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/digitalbridges/projects/apollo_theater_project.html">Apollo Theater Project </a>was a multifaceted initiative to document, preserve, and disseminate the history of the Apollo Theater and the Harlem community. The Columbia University Oral History Research Office (OHRO) is conducting more than 150 hours of interviews with cultural and political figures such as Smokey Robinson, Leslie Uggams and Gordon Anderson, who are connected with the 75-year history of the Theater. CCNMTL is assisting in capturing video interviews and is working with Columbia University faculty to integrate the interview footage into the classroom.

The Apollo Theater Project is a collaboration between the OHRO, the Apollo Theater Foundation, CCNMTL, and the Center for Digital Research and Scholarship at Columbia.
