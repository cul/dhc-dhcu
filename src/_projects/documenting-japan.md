In May 2010, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/McKelway.html">Matthew McKelway</a>, Atsumi Associate Professor of Japanese Art,<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Reynolds.html">Jonathan Reynolds</a>, Associate Professor of Japanese Architecture and Visual Culture, and Media Center staff members Caleb Smith and Cassy Juhl traveled to Japan to photograph architecture from the 8th through the early 21st Century. The project, the Media Center's second funded by <a href="http://artstor.wordpress.com/2011/12/15/now-available-images-of-architecture-in-japan-and-chicago-from-columbia-university/">ARTstor</a>, a non-profit digital image database created by the Andrew Mellon Foundation, produced 360-degree digital panoramas of interior and exterior spaces, as well as high-resolution digital photographs.

This photo campaign represents the first time interior images of temples such as Muroji and Jishoji have been made available to broad audiences outside Japan. Aaron Rio, PhD candidate in Japanese art, and Visiting Scholar Sen So-oku, assisted in negotiating access to the famously off-limit sites around Kyoto and Nara.
