The <a href="http://socialjustice.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/index.php/Main_Page">Social Justice Movements website</a> was first developed by students at Columbia University and Barnard College enrolled in 'Black Movements in the U.S.' taught by Professor <a href="http://socialjustice.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/index.php/User:Rdk21">Robin D. G. Kelley</a>. The purpose of the site is to introduce students and the general public to a few of the most dynamic social justice organizations in New York City. Students worked in groups of three and each group was responsible for creating a web page devoted to one organization. Students were required to interview organizers and conduct library research on the history and current activities on the organizations for which they were responsible. Each page includes a link to the respective organization's website, thus our site serves as a kind of portal into some of the key social justice movements in the city.
