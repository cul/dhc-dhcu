We aim to create a data-rich digital repository of rare manuscripts from the Muslim world in the holdings at Columbia University. The archive will engage critically with questions of access, marginality, scholarly and enthusiast collecting, and related issues. It will build on some of the work undertaken by the Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities at their Mumbai meeting on free archives and shadow libraries. The first event for the project is a 3-day conference. You can learn the details here.
