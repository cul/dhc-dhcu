Since its debut in Fall 2010, <a href="http://www.mediathread.info/">Mediathread</a> has helped users to closely study multimedia objects from across the web. Originally developed by the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning, it has been used in over 250 courses at Columbia in a wide range of subject domains, including Art History, Film Studies, Social Work, Education, Journalism, Music, and Religious Studies. The platform interoperates with a growing variety of websites, such as YouTube, Flickr, ARTstor, OpenVault, the Internet Archive, Vimeo, Wikimedia Commons, Pinterest, and Kaltura collections. Because of this interoperation and its open source code, Mediathread is now also being adopted at other higher education institutions, including MIT, Dartmouth, Wellesley, and the University of Maine.
