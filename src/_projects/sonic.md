The <a href="https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/itc/music/sonic/index.html">Sonic Glossary</a> is an innovative teaching tool for music appreciation. It assumes no musical training on the part of the user. It defines musical terms by combining visual text, spoken voice, pictures, graphic images, and musical sound in creative ways, delivering them in high-quality audio for private study. The Sonic Glossary does not replace classroom teaching: at Columbia University Music Humanities is taught by small-group discussion, which the Sonic Glossary reinforces and amplifies.

The Sonic Glossary is available to Columbia students over the campus network. Definitions are written by the teaching staff of Music Humanities, sound is recorded and mixed by the Computer Music Center, and the illustrations and animations are generated at CCNMTL. The finished components are then compiled and released on the Web. There are more than eighty definitions (Summer 2001), and the Sonic Glossary will continue to grow as more definitions are written by the teaching staff.
