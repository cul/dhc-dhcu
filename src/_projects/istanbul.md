Istanbul is a city with a fascinating history that stretches over three millennia. Having served as the capital of two successive empires, namely the Late Roman or Byzantine Empire (330–1453) and the Ottoman Empire (1453–1922), it is today a rich palimpsest of cultures and artistic traditions, in which architectural monuments of its Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman past serve as sites of historical and cultural memory woven into the ever-changing fabric of a 21st-century metropolis.

The Istanbul Documentation Project, developed by Professor Holger A. Klein of Columbia University's Department of Art History and Archaeology in collaboration with the Media Center for Art History, aims to create a digital platform for the virtual presentation of Istanbul's Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and early Republican sites and monuments and thus provides a rich resource for scholars, students, and the general public to study the deep history of the city in preparation for site visits and as a tool for individual study, research, and teaching in the classroom.

Columbia University is inviting proposals from institutions and individual scholars, who are interested to participate in joining us in our venture. For further information, contact Professor Holger A. Klein at hak56@columbia.edu.
