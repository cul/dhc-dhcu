In the fall of 2012, and running in parallel with the expansion of the Digital Humanities Center, the Humanities & History Division of the Libraries initiated the Developing Librarian Project (DLP), a two-year training program, with the goal of acquiring new skills and methodologies in digital humanities. The DLP was created by and for librarians and other professional staff in the Humanities and History division. The team originally found its impetus from two influential publications, “Re-skilling for Research” published by RLUK and “Research Support Services for Scholars: History” by Ithaka S+R. Since then the team has continued to learn from many librarians who are thinking in this space—Kari Kraus, Trevor Muñoz, Angela Courtney and Harriett Green, Dorothea Salo, Michelle Dalmau, Bethany Nowviskie, Miriam Posner, Chella Vaidyanathan, and many others.

The program is based on the assumption that learning must happen in context, a model we borrow from the Praxis Program; therefore the training is project-based with all participants engaged in creating a digital humanities research project as a team.  The team hopes that this approach will enable them to learn about new tools in a sustained manner that parallels the way other humanities researchers are likely to use them.  The team designed a set of practical training units and exercises for the purpose of individual or group learning and skills development. The program also adds variations to the graduate student centered models used in the Praxis Network, adapting the project to the needs of mid-career professionals. As a result, the model might inform similar projects at other libraries, from small liberal arts colleges to public and private research universities.
