The enormous growth in the number of official documents—many of them withheld from scholars and journalists even decades later—has raised serious concerns about whether traditional research methods are adequate for ensuring government accountability. But the millions of documents that have been released, often in digital form, also create opportunities to use <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a> and <a href="http://ccls.columbia.edu/research/machine-learning" target="blank">statistical/machine learning</a> to explore the historical record in very new ways. Historians, journalists, legal scholars, librarians, statisticians, and computer scientists are joining together to determine whether novel statistical/machine learning methodologies can accelerate the declassification process, or at least help illuminate the broad patterns of official secrecy. 

The History Lab's Freedom of Information Archive seeks to house a vast range of documents and provide the public with the necessary tools for analysing them.
