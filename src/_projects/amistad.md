A number of state legislatures across the country have recently passed educational mandates requiring the integration of African-American history into the social studies curriculum in K-12 public schools, to provide a more inclusive and accurate record of American history. This legislation is expanding state by state, and teachers will increasingly need resources to help them understand and teach a new American history curriculum that more fully integrates the history of the freedom struggle.

The <a href="http://www.amistadresource.org/">Amistad Digital Resource</a> provides a much-needed solution to help teachers fulfill this new curricular requirement. It is designed not as a classroom text, but as a unique multimedia resource for secondary school teachers to enhance their knowledge and ability in teaching African-American history. When completed, it will include hundreds of rare and iconic photographs, audio recordings, news clips, and excerpts of oral history interviews with a descriptive narrative text explaining significant themes and key events in African-American history, from slavery to the twenty-first century.
