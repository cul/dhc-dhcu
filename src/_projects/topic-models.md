Topic models are a suite of algorithms that uncover the hidden thematic structure in document collections. These algorithms help us develop new ways to search, browse and summarize large archives of texts. <a title="Latent Dirichlet allocation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation">Latent Dirichlet allocation</a> (LDA), perhaps the most common topic model currently in use, was developed by current Columbia Professor <a title="David Blei" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blei">David Blei</a>, working with Andrew Ng, and Michael I. Jordan in 2002, allowing documents to have a mixture of topics. Naturally, topic modeling—and LDA in particular—has become an important technique in digital humanities.
