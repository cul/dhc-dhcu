Originally designed for a meeting of the Medieval Academy of America in April 2002, the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/music/manuscripts/index.html">updated website</a> has been used by Columbia University music and religion courses and the public. The primary feature of the site is a Web exhibit containing slideshows of original medieval manuscripts arranged by type of manuscript; each manuscript type is also explained. The site also features related music clips, recommended readings, and additional online resources.
