In the context of the course "Minimal Editions: From the Manuscript to the Web," taught in the [Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures](http://laic.columbia.edu/), Susanna Allés and Alex Gil undertook a pedagogical experiment in which they introduced students to the basic and general principles of textual criticism and the essential technologies needed for students to publish their own digital scholarly editions.

The resulting edition is a good example of the sort of digital humanities work we can expect to accomplish in the language instruction and literature classroom.
