The Women Film Pioneers Project (WFPP) is a freely accessible, collaborative online database that showcases the hundreds of women who worked behind-the-scenes in the silent film industry as directors, producers, editors, and more. Always expanding, the database features career profiles on each pioneer, longer overview essays on national cinemas and occupations, still and moving images, and archival and bibliographic resource materials. The goals of WFPP are to  jumpstart historical research on the work of women filmmakers from the early years of cinema, ending with the coming of sound;  to facilitate a cross-national  connection between researchers; to reconfigure world film knowledge by foregrounding an undocumented phenomenon: these women worked in many capacities.

Started in 1993 when Professor Jane Gaines was a visiting professor at Vassar College, WFPP was first imagined as a multi-volume book set. The project was caught in the transition from print culture to online publishing. Selected as a pilot project for the new Columbia University Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, it launched in September 2013 as an online resource instead. Over the years, students from the Radcliffe Institute, Stockholm University, Duke University,  Columbia University, and Barnard College have worked on the project.
