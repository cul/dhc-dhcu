<a href="http://projects.mcah.columbia.edu/amiens-arthum/about"></a>>Life of a Gothic Cathedral: Notre-Dame of Amiens 1220-1530</a> is intended to change the way we understand and teach the cathedral. This website allows you to see that Amiens Cathedral is not a thing of the distant past "1220-1269:" it manifestly exists in our own time and space. The "completion" date of 1269 (derived from the inscription of the choir axial window) is deceptive: artistic production in the Gothic mode continued for three hundred years, down to the 1530 death of the last great building dean, Adrien de HÃ©nencourt.

The three-hundred year "life" of the Gothic cathedral embraced the agency of three overlapping worlds of makers and users: the layfolk who visit it, the clergy in their sumptuous choir and the artisans who built it. The website will allow you to enter into each of these three worlds. You can do this by clicking on the three major buttons at the top of the home page or by reading the EText which is linked with the images.
